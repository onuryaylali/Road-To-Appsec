February 3, 2026: Advanced Malware Analysis - Behavioral Patterns & AI Insights
1. Kernel-Level Monitoring: Sysmon Integration
I integrated Sysmon into my sandbox environment to achieve deep visibility into OS-level events.

Process Tracking: Monitoring ProcessCreation and ProcessAccess events to detect process injection and stealthy execution.

Network Visibility: Capturing outbound connections to identify Command & Control (C2) communication patterns.

2. Behavioral Scoring & MITRE ATT&CK Mapping
Developed a custom Scoring Engine to transform raw logs into actionable intelligence.

Detection Logic
Pattern Matching: I defined specific behavioral signatures (e.g., unauthorized registry modifications, suspicious API call sequences). Each match increments the file’s Malicious Score.

Framework Alignment: Every detected suspicious activity is automatically mapped to MITRE ATT&CK techniques.

Example: Detecting a remote thread creation maps to T1055 (Process Injection).

3. Automated Reporting: Google Gemini AI Insights
To solve the problem of analyzing massive JSON reports, I integrated Google Gemini AI for automated summarization.

The Pipeline
JSON Extraction: My script filters the most critical data points (High-score patterns, C2 IPs, Modified files) from the raw report.

Contextual Prompting: This filtered data is sent to the LLM as a structured prompt.

AI Insights: The AI generates a human-readable summary, detailing:

The probable intent of the malware.

Potential Malware Family classification.

Remediation steps for incident response.
