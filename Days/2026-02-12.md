# February 13, 2026: Evasion, Hybrid Exploitation & Security Boundaries

> **Goal:** Advancing beyond basic XSS to explore WAF evasion techniques, hybrid attack chains (XSS-powered CSRF), and auditing modern browser-side defense mechanisms.

---

## 1. WAF Evasion & Payload Obfuscation
Investigated how attackers bypass signature-based Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) using encoding and obfuscation.
* **Dynamic Character Encoding:** Analyzed the use of `String.fromCharCode()` and `eval()` to hide malicious keywords (e.g., `alert`, `script`) from static pattern matching.
* **Mechanism:** Transforming ASCII codes into executable JS at runtime, effectively rendering "blacklist" security models obsolete.
* **Engineering Reflection:** Security cannot rely on keyword filtering. True defense lies in **Context-Aware Output Encoding** rather than input-side blacklisting.

## 2. Hybrid Attacks: XSS-powered CSRF ("God Mode")
Deconstructed the synergy between XSS and CSRF, where XSS acts as a force multiplier to dismantle modern CSRF protections.
* **Bypassing Anti-CSRF Tokens:** Analyzed how a script injected via XSS, running within the "Same-Origin," can programmatically read hidden CSRF tokens from the DOM and append them to unauthorized requests.
* **The Impact:** This hybrid chain bypasses `SameSite` cookie attributes and token-based defenses, granting the attacker full operational control over the user's session.

## 3. Auditing Mitigation: CSP & Trusted Types
Evaluated modern browser-side defenses and the common pitfalls in their implementation.
* **CSP (Content Security Policy):** Explored how a strict policy (`script-src 'self'`) prevents the execution of external malicious scripts. 
* **The 'self' Vulnerability:** Identified how trust in one's own domain can be exploited via JSONP bypasses or vulnerable client-side libraries.
* **Trusted Types:** Researched the transition from "string-based" to "object-based" sink management to fundamentally eradicate DOM XSS.

## 4. Practical Implementation & Lab Results
Validated theoretical knowledge through hands-on exploitation in PortSwigger Academy.
* **[PortSwigger Lab] Reflected XSS (Apprentice):** Successfully identified a reflection point in search parameters and executed a basic payload by manipulating the HTML context.
* **[PortSwigger Lab] DOM-based XSS (Apprentice):** Analyzed a `window.location` source flowing into an `innerHTML` sink. Exploited the lack of sanitization to execute arbitrary JS without a server-side roundtrip.
