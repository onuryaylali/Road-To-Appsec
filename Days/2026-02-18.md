# February 18, 2026: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) Deep Dive & Signature Vulnerabilities

> **Goal:** Deconstructing the stateless authentication model of JWTs and auditing the cryptographic flaws that allow for identity impersonation.

---

## 1. JWT Anatomy & State Management
Verified the internal structure of JSON Web Tokens and the transition from stateful sessions to stateless claims.
* **Structure:** Consists of three Base64URL-encoded segments: **Header** (Algorithm/Type), **Payload** (Claims like `sub`, `exp`, `iat`), and **Signature**.
* **Statelessness:** Since the token contains all user data, the server doesn't need a database lookup to verify the user, but this introduces the challenge of immediate token revocation.

## 2. Advanced Attack Vectors
Researched how implementation flaws in JWT libraries can be weaponized:
* **Algorithm Confusion (Asymmetric to Symmetric):** Forcing the server to verify an **RS256** (Asymmetric) token using **HS256** (Symmetric), where the attacker signs the token using the server's public key as the secret.
* **The "None" Algorithm:** Exploiting legacy or debug configurations where the server accepts `alg: none`, allowing an attacker to modify the payload and bypass signature verification entirely.
* **Weak Secret Brute-forcing:** Using tools like `hashcat` to perform offline brute-force attacks on tokens signed with low-entropy secrets.

## 3. Mitigation & Defense-in-Depth
* **Algorithm Hardcoding:** The application should explicitly define the expected algorithm (e.g., `RS256` only) and reject all others.
* **Short-lived Tokens & Rotation:** Implementing short `exp` (expiry) times paired with a secure **Refresh Token** flow to minimize the impact of a stolen JWT.
* **Claim Validation:** Ensuring that the `iss` (issuer) and `aud` (audience) claims are strictly validated to prevent "token substitution" across different services.
