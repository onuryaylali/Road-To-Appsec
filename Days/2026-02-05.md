# February 5, 2026: Authentication, Authorization & Access Control Logic

## 1. Authentication (AuthN) vs. Authorization (AuthZ)
Today, I focused on the critical distinction between identity verification and permission management, which is the cornerstone of Application Security.

* **Authentication (AuthN):** "Who are you?" - The process of verifying a user's identity (e.g., Passwords, 2FA).
* **Authorization (AuthZ):** "What are you allowed to do?" - The process of verifying permissions once identity is established (e.g., RBAC, ABAC).

## 2. PortSwigger Labs (Apprentice Level) - Completed
Successfully solved 11+ labs focusing on broken authentication and access control vulnerabilities:

### Key Vulnerabilities Explored:
* **Horizontal Privilege Escalation:** Accessing other users' data (e.g., Carlos's account) using predictable GUIDs or insecure parameters.
* **Vertical Privilege Escalation:** Gaining administrative access through unprotected admin functionalities or by modifying request parameters (e.g., `admin=true`).
* **Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR):** Exploiting direct access to files or database records by manipulating IDs in the URL or request body.
* **Broken Logic in Auth Flow:** Bypassing 2FA or password reset mechanisms by exploiting flaws in the application's step-by-step logic.
* **Information Leakage in Redirects:** Extracting sensitive data (like tokens or user IDs) that the server inadvertently reveals during a 302 redirect.

## 3. AppSec Engineering Insights
* **The "Robots.txt" Paradox:** While intended for bots, `robots.txt` often serves as a reconnaissance map for attackers by revealing hidden directories like `/wp-admin/`.
* **Proper Mitigation:** Real security comes from **server-side checks**, not "security by obscurity." Every request must be validated against the user's session to ensure they have the right to access that specific resource.
* **Logic over Syntax:** Many AuthZ vulnerabilities cannot be caught by automated scanners because they are flaws in the business logic (e.g., "Can user A see user B's invoice?").

## 4. Tools Used
* **Burp Suite (Repeater & Proxy):** Intercepting and modifying GET/POST requests to test IDOR and role manipulation.
* **Developer Tools:** Analyzing page source and network responses for GUID leakage.
