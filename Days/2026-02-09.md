# February 9, 2026: Anatomy of XSS - From Volatile Vectors to Persistent Outbreaks

> **Goal:** Deconstructing Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) internals, focusing on request-response cycles, database persistence, and modern browser-side sinks.

---

## 1. Reflected XSS: The Volatile Vector
Analyzed the immediate "Echo" mechanism where user input is reflected back to the browser without proper validation.
* **Mechanism:** Input -> Server -> Response (Immediate Echo).
* **Volatile Nature:** Non-persistent. The payload must be delivered in every request (e.g., via a malicious link).
* **Impact:** Session hijacking, page defacement, and unauthorized actions on behalf of the user.
* **Engineering Reflection:** Any dynamic data from the server can be interpreted as "code" by the browser. Context-aware encoding is the only way to separate data from logic.

## 2. Stored XSS: Database Persistence & "Outbreaks"
Explored the dangerous transition where a payload becomes a permanent part of the application's infrastructure.
* **Mechanism:** Input -> Database -> Multiple Users' Responses.
* **Blind XSS Scenario:** Researched how a low-privileged user can target high-privileged admins by injecting payloads into administrative logs or support tickets.
* **Impact:** Wide-scale "Outbreak" scenarios where every visitor to a specific page is compromised.
* **Engineering Reflection:** Never treat the database as a "Safe Zone." Every byte retrieved from storage must be treated as untrusted user input at the point of output.

## 3. DOM-Based & Out-of-Band (OOB) XSS
Shifted focus to modern client-side vulnerabilities and advanced exfiltration techniques.
* **DOM XSS:** Entirely browser-side. Analyzed the relationship between **Sources** (e.g., `location.search`) and **Sinks** (e.g., `innerHTML`).
* **Modern Framework Risks:** Identified how "escape hatches" like `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` in React create significant security gaps.
* **Blind/OOB XSS:** The "Fire and Forget" strategy. Results are monitored on external attacker-controlled servers (Out-of-band), bypassing traditional request-response visibility.
* **Mitigation:** If `innerHTML` is unavoidable, data must be sanitized using specialized libraries like **DOMPurify**.

## 4. Senior Perspective: Impact & Weaponization
Reframed XSS not as a simple "alert(1)" box, but as a sophisticated delivery mechanism.
* **Weaponization:** XSS acts as a "Hook" to gain control over the victim's browser, enabling full DOM manipulation.
* **The Golden Rule:** Mitigation requires more than just input sanitization. One must know exactly **where** the output is rendered (HTML context, Attribute context, JS, or CSS) and apply context-specific encoding accordingly.
