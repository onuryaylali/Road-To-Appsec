# February 2, 2026: SSL/TLS Fundamentals & TLS 1.3 Evolution

## 1. Essential Security Concepts
Today, I reviewed the core pillars of information security that form the foundation of secure communication.

* **CIA Triad:** * **Confidentiality:** Ensuring data is accessible only to authorized parties (Encryption).
    * **Integrity:** Ensuring data has not been tampered with (Hashing/Digital Signatures).
    * **Availability:** Ensuring systems and data are available when needed.
* **Forward Secrecy (PFS):** A feature of specific key agreement protocols that ensures that even if the server's private key is compromised in the future, past session keys remain secure.

## 2. SSL/TLS Protocol Analysis
I did a deep dive into how TLS secures the transport layer and the significant improvements introduced in the latest version.

### TLS 1.2 vs. TLS 1.3 Comparison
TLS 1.3 is not just an update; it's a major overhaul focused on speed and security.

| Feature | TLS 1.2 | TLS 1.3 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Handshake Latency** | 2-RTT (Round Trip Times) | 1-RTT |
| **0-RTT Mode** | No | Yes (Fast session resumption) |
| **Static RSA/Diffie-Hellman** | Supported (Risk to Forward Secrecy) | Removed (Only Ephemeral DH) |
| **Vulnerable Ciphers** | Supports RC4, DES, CBC (Weak) | Removed all legacy/weak ciphers |
| **Encrypted Handshake** | Partial (Extensions visible) | Almost entirely encrypted |

### Key Takeaways
* **Handshake Optimization:** TLS 1.3 reduces the handshake from two round trips to one, significantly decreasing latency.
* **Privacy Enhancements:** In TLS 1.3, more of the handshake is encrypted, hiding more information (like certificates) from passive eavesdroppers.
* **0-RTT Risk:** While 0-RTT improves speed for returning users, it is susceptible to **Replay Attacks** if not implemented with proper application-level guards.

## 3. Cryptographic Primitives
* **Symmetric Encryption:** Used for bulk data transfer (AES).
* **Asymmetric Encryption:** Used for key exchange and identity verification (RSA, Elliptic Curve).
* **Hashing:** Ensuring message integrity (SHA-256).
