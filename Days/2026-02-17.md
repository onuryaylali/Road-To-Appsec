# February 17, 2026: CORS Mechanisms, Misconfigurations & Exploitation Scenarios

> **Goal:** Analyzing how the Same-Origin Policy (SOP) is selectively relaxed via CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) and identifying the architectural flaws that lead to cross-origin data leakage.

---

## 1. SOP vs. CORS: The Security Equilibrium
I reviewed the fundamental tension between browser security and modern web functionality.
* **Same-Origin Policy (SOP):** A critical security boundary that prevents a script on one origin (e.g., `attacker.com`) from reading data from another origin (e.g., `bank.com`).
* **CORS:** A mechanism that uses additional HTTP headers to tell browsers to give a web application running at one origin access to selected resources from a different origin.

## 2. Preflight (OPTIONS) & The Handshake Process
Deep-dived into how browsers handle "non-simple" requests to prevent unauthorized actions on legacy servers.
* **Trigger Mechanism:** Requests involving JSON payloads (`application/json`) or custom headers (e.g., `X-Requested-With`) trigger a **Preflight** request.
* **The Handshake:** The browser sends an `OPTIONS` request with `Access-Control-Request-Method`. The server must respond with appropriate `Access-Control-Allow-*` headers before the actual request is sent.

## 3. Critical CORS Misconfigurations
Analyzed common implementation errors that effectively neutralize SOP:
* **Reflected Origin:** The server reads the `Origin` header from the request and reflects it back in `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`. This allows *any* site to read the response.
* **The Wildcard (*) vs. Credentials Paradox:** While `*` is safe for public data, browsers block requests where `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true` is paired with a wildcard. Attackers bypass this by exploiting dynamic origin reflection.
* **Null Origin Vulnerability:** Misconfiguring the allow-list to include `null` allows local files or sandboxed `iframes` to bypass cross-origin restrictions.

## 4. AppSec Engineering Reflection
CORS is not a security tool; it is a **relaxation** of security. A secure implementation must follow the principle of least privilege by using a strict allow-list of trusted origins and never relying on the `Origin` header without server-side validation.
