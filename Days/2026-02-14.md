# February 14, 2026: REST Architecture, CRUD Operations & API Security

> **Goal:** Understanding the architectural constraints of RESTful services and the security implications of CRUD-to-HTTP mapping.

---

## 1. RESTful Principles & Constraints
Analyzed the foundational constraints of Representational State Transfer (REST) and how they influence the attack surface of modern web APIs.
* **Statelessness:** Evaluated the security requirement where each request must contain all necessary information (e.g., JWT/Tokens) for processing. This shifts the security burden from server-side session state to robust token validation.
* **Uniform Interface:** Studied how standardized interactions (HTTP Verbs) simplify client-server communication but also provide a predictable roadmap for attackers during API reconnaissance.

## 2. CRUD to HTTP Mapping & Security Characteristics
Mapped database operations to their respective HTTP methods, focusing on idempotency and specific vulnerability vectors.

| CRUD Operation | HTTP Method | Idempotent | AppSec Observation |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :--- |
| **Create** | POST | No | Primary target for resource exhaustion and lack of rate limiting. |
| **Read** | GET | Yes | High risk of sensitive data leakage via URL parameters or server logs. |
| **Update (Full)** | PUT | Yes | Misconfigurations can lead to unauthorized file overwrites or RCE. |
| **Update (Partial)**| PATCH | No | Complex logic often leads to partial bypasses in validation schemas. |
| **Delete** | DELETE | Yes | Requires strict authorization checks to prevent mass data deletion. |

## 3. API Security: Beyond Traditional Web Vulnerabilities
Deep-dived into the OWASP API Security Top 10, focusing on how REST designs are specifically exploited.
* **BOLA (Broken Object Level Authorization):** Analyzed how manipulating resource IDs in the URI (e.g., `/api/v1/users/{ID}`) can lead to unauthorized data access—the API-centric evolution of IDOR.
* **Mass Assignment:** Researched how binding untrusted input directly to internal models allows attackers to modify sensitive fields (e.g., `is_admin`) by injecting unexpected JSON keys.
* **Excessive Data Exposure:** Identified risks where APIs return full object structures,
