# January 30, 2026: HTTP Methods, Protocol Evolution & Info Disclosure

## 1. HTTP Methods Analysis
Today, I analyzed the characteristics of HTTP methods and their security implications during penetration testing.

| Method | Safe | Idempotent | Cacheable | Pentest Note |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| **GET** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Sensitive data should never be in the URL (Risk of log leakage). |
| **HEAD** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Useful for checking file existence and version disclosure. |
| **POST** | No | No | Partial | Must be protected against CSRF attacks. |
| **PUT** | No | Yes | No | **Critical:** Risk of RCE (Web Shell upload) if misconfigured. |
| **DELETE** | No | Yes | No | Risk of unauthorized file/data deletion. |
| **OPTIONS** | Yes | Yes | No | Reveals the attack surface via the `Allow` header. |
| **TRACE** | Yes | Yes | No | Used for **XST (Cross-Site Tracing)** attacks. |
| **PATCH** | No | No | Partial | Efficient for partial updates; ensures data integrity. |

### PUT vs POST Comparison
* **PUT:** Replaces the resource at the target URL entirely or creates it. It is **Idempotent**, meaning repeated identical requests have the same effect.
* **POST:** Sends data to a handler to be processed. Often creates a new resource (Not idempotent).



## 2. PortSwigger Labs (Apprentice Level)
Completed 3 labs under the **Information Disclosure** category:
1. **Error Messages:** Extracting server versions and library info from verbose errors.
2. **Debug Page:** Leaking environmental variables via developer-specific pages.
3. **Source Code Disclosure:** Finding sensitive code via backup files (e.g., `.bak`, `.old`).

## 3. HTTP Evolution
* **HTTP/1.1:** Introduced **Persistent Connections** (Keep-Alive) to reduce TCP overhead.
* **HTTP/2:** A binary protocol. Solved **Head-of-Line (HOL) Blocking** at the application layer using Multiplexing.
* **HTTP/3:** Uses **QUIC** (UDP-based). Eliminates HOL blocking at the transport layer entirely.
